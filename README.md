## Explanation of what aspect of the project is innovative, and why:
This problem is innovative because it offers older users the privacy they need instead of using the locator 
app where parental unit/emergency contacts will not know your very step, this offers people a way to let 
their emergency contact if they feel a bit unsafe and uncertain of their safety they can get an alert sent out. The 
current apps, whether they are mobile and or web-based apps, they have features of alerting the userâ€™s emergency 
contacts about where they are at all times, or to get help from local authorities, however many of 
these features cost money and are required for some sort of monthly subscription. Safety is a basic human right,
No one should be afraid of not being able to go back home, and for that reason the Locatable web-based app 
will be free to its users and not store/sell the users sensitive information.
