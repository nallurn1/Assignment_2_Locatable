<h1>Locatable</h1>

<p>
  Welcome... Do you feel unsafe? If so 
  <ul>
    <li>Rails 6 (the project, at least)</li>
    <li>Bootstrap 4</li>
    <li>Devise user authentication system</li>
    <li>better_errors (replace default error page with a better one)</li>
    <li>web_console (put <mark><%% console %></mark> in a view to have a console on the page)</li>
    <li>A basic layout</li>
    <li>User logins</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Devise</h3>
<p>
  Devise is a user authenitification system for ruby on rails designed around
  another program called warden. You will not need to change anything regarding
  its settings unless you are changing login behavior, which is unlikely.
</p>
<p>
  To make a page not require login, add <mark>skip_before_action :authenticate_user!</mark>
  on top of the controller. To limit it to specific methods of a controller,
  tack on <mark>only: ['method_name']</mark> at the end of the line.
  You can add more than one method.
</p>
<h3>Bootstrap</h3>
<p>
  Bootstrap is a CSS and javascript library made by twitter to "bootstrap"
  website development. CSS can be very difficult to work with. Bootstrap
  makes it dramatically easier by giving you an entire library of premade
  classes. For more details,
  <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/">
    see the documentation</a>.
